[[About](#about) · [Speakers](#conference-speakers) · [Call for Abstracts](#call-for-abstracts)]

A two-day conference on the philosophy of deep learning, organized by [Raphaël Millière](https://raphaelmilliere.com) (Columbia University), [David Chalmers](https://consc.net/) (New York University) and [Ned Block](https://www.nedblock.us/) (New York University), and jointly sponsored by the [Center for Science and Society](https://scienceandsociety.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University and the [Center for Mind, Brain, and Consciousness](https://wp.nyu.edu/consciousness/) at New York University.

## About

The conference will explore current issues in AI research from the perspective of the philosophy of mind, cognitive science, neuroscience, and computational linguistics, with a particular attention to recent work on deep artificial neural networks. The goal is to bring together leading philosophers and scientists working on gaining a better understanding of the capacities and limitations of artificial neural networks developed in AI research, as well as establishing fair and meaningful comparisons with human cognition in various domains – such as vision, language understanding, reasoning, planning, and memory. 

Current research in the philosophy of AI focuses mostly on practical issues about short- and long-term concerns with the development and use of AI algorithm. While these issues are very important in their own right, many of them can benefit from a deeper theoretical understanding of algorithms used in AI research. Furthermore, there is currently a convergence of interest for a more foundational approach to the philosophy of AI, that seeks to understand the kinds of capacities we can ascribe to AI models, how they might differ from human minds, and remaining hurdles on the path to human-like intelligence. 

The purpose of this conference is to tackle these issues head-on, and further establish this research program in philosophy. It will explore questions such as:

- What kind of representations can we ascribe to artificial neural networks?
- How might such representations differ from those ascribed to biological neural networks in neuroscience?
- How can we develop a mechanistic understanding of artificial and biological neural networks?
- What notion of mechanistic explanation might be appropriate to this project?
- Can artificial neural networks understand language and the world like humans do?
- What can we learn about human perception and cognition from building and studying neural networks?

A pre-conference debate on Friday, March 24th will tackle the question "Do large language models need sensory grounding for meaning and understanding ?" (speakers TBC).
